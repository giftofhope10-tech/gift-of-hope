### Step 3: Create High-Value SEO Content (Start This Week!)

**Problem:** Right now you only have basic pages. Google needs **quality content** to understand what you're about.

**Solution:** Create a BLOG section with articles targeting donation keywords.

**Blog Topics to Create (Priority Keywords):**

1. ✍️ "How to Choose the Best Donation Organization in 2025" (2000+ words)
2. ✍️ "Top 10 Ways Your Donation Helps Communities Worldwide"
3. ✍️ "Complete Guide to Tax-Deductible Charitable Donations"
4. ✍️ "Why Online Donations Are Safe & Secure (PayPal Guide)"
5. ✍️ "5 Questions to Ask Before Donating to a Charity"
6. ✍️ "Food, Education & Healthcare: Impact of Your Donation"
7. ✍️ "How to Track Where Your Donation Goes (Transparency Guide)"
8. ✍️ "Best Times to Donate to Charity (Tax & Impact Guide)"
9. ✍️ "Nonprofit vs For-Profit: Understanding Charitable Organizations"
10. ✍️ "How Small Donations Make Big Impacts"

**Each Blog Post Must Have:**
- 1500-2500 words
- Target keyword in title
- H2 and H3 headings with keywords
- Images with alt text
- Internal links to donation page
- FAQ section at bottom
- Schema markup for Article

**Publishing Schedule:** 2 blog posts per week = 8 posts per month

**Expected Result:** Ranking for long-tail keywords in 4-8 weeks

---

## 🎯 TARGET KEYWORDS STRATEGY

**Don't Target These (Too Competitive):**
- ❌ "donate" - 2.5M monthly searches (impossible to rank)
- ❌ "charity" - 1.8M monthly searches
- ❌ "nonprofit organization" - 800K searches

**Target These Instead (Realistic & High-Converting):**

### Primary Keywords (Medium Competition):
1. "best donation organization 2025" - 12K searches/month
2. "donate to help poor families online" - 8K searches
3. "trusted charity website PayPal" - 5K searches
4. "transparent nonprofit organization" - 4K searches
5. "where to donate for maximum impact" - 6K searches

### Long-Tail Keywords (Low Competition, High Intent):
1. "how to donate food to charity online" - 2K searches
2. "best humanitarian aid organizations" - 3K searches
3. "nonprofit education programs donations" - 1.5K searches
4. "safe online donation platform PayPal" - 2.5K searches
5. "charity with transparent financial reports" - 1K searches

### Local Keywords (If You Have Physical Location):
- "donation center near me [city name]"
- "food bank volunteer opportunities [city]"
- "donate to local families [city]"
